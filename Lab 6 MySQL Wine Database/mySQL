/*This program reads the wine information that is stored in the SQL

 * information. User could find wines between a price range, between a 
 * rating range, sort it by price and sort by rating. This can help the 
 * wine users filter out the wines based on either price or rating. It 
 * displays all the wines in an organized table-like layout that has 
 * lined-up columns for every desired wine information.
